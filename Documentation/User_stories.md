Users

Lab bench user: More advanced user that makes edits or is trying to implement the software for a given purpose in their field. Major interaction with background knowledge in python and the softwares uses, primary user until “at home” verison is created. 
Clinicians: Takes the samples from the patient provides to lab, reports results to the patient. Could be a primary user for an at home/ in clinic software. Limited background knowledge of jupyter notebooks/python.
Assay developers: Develop assays for different diseases and apply our detection method to their assay. This user applies their sample and standards to produce a new model for quantification of new diseases. Ideally interacts with the software at a deeper level (command line) to alter the parameters to match their setup (focal length, target recognition, etc). This user has fundamental assay knowledge to allow them to produce the imaging prototype box, understands the fluorescence readout mechanism (what fluorescent channels are being utilized).  

Programer: Trains the machine learning algorithm for software. Programmers need to get access to many sample images, run the codes for analysis and compare the results with PCR data. The images the patient got from the cellphone should be submitted to cloud and the program should take the images and return the results to the cellphone. 

Patient: Provides sample and then receives results in further versions will be the only user that interacts with the application for “at home” use. Limited or no background knowledge of jupyter notebooks/python.
