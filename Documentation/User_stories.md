# Users Stories 
## Assay developers:
Advanced user that uses and modifies the software to apply the workflow to develop new assays for different diseases. This user applies their sample and standards to produce a new model for quantification of new diseases. Ideally interacts with the software at a deeper level (command line) to alter the parameters to match their setup (focal length, target recognition, etc.). This user has fundamental assay knowledge to allow them to produce the imaging prototype box, understands the fluorescence readout mechanism (what fluorescent channels are being utilized). 

## Lab bench user:
More advanced user that makes edits or is trying to implement the software for the purpose of subtype or variant detection of existing models. This user has major interaction with the software and has background knowledge in python. This user is the primary user until “at home” version is created. Ideally interacts with the software from a cloned repo or website. Compared to the assay developer, the lab bench user is an optimizer or a new project member who is trying to extend the model rather than create a new model.

## Clinicians:
Demonstrates point of care use case, takes the samples from the patient, and runs a diagnostic test and reports results to the patient. This user would be the primary user for an at home/ in clinic software planned for future development. This user has limited to no background knowledge of jupyter notebooks/python.

## Programmer:
Trains the machine learning algorithm for software. Programmers need to get access to many sample images, run the codes for analysis and compare the results with PCR data. The images the patient got from the cellphone should be locally processed. 

## Patient:
Provides sample and then receives results in further versions will be the only user that interacts with the application for “at home” use. Limited or no background knowledge of jupyter notebooks/python.
