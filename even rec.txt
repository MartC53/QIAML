low med high
model looks good because copy numbers are the same in train, validation and split
ie all have 100, 300 ect would be better if val or test were 200, 400, 800

regressor was heavy, had to decrease batch size to make it run- bad error shot up.

train with batch of zero-all data typically comp heavy but data is small.
