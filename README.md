goals:
  - cnn-classification 
  - skikit leran 
  - tensor flow
  - patters-unsuperviiers
  -   intensity prediction 
  - supervised-features-target goal 
  - need x and target value for ML
  - classificaton- 
 whats the problem 
 who are the users and skill level
 is the user a developer of diagnotics what to expect
 what makes this a sucess-linearizing the range of response
